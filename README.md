# Target-Supplier
This project aims to collect supplier information and classify them based on their business scope. 
It allows the suppliers to register themselves in a database which can be easily accessed by the buyers, expediters and mangers.

The application consists of:
1- Registration form online: (Suppliers view): page: index.aspx
To gather supplierâ€™s information by allowing the suppliers to register themselves with all the required data through an online registration form.
2- Database:
To store the data provided by the supplier, manipulating it and make it easy to retrieve, read and organize.
3- Excel Sheet. (Buyer view):
Anabel the buyer to retrieve the data he need from the database using Excel. I didnt uploud the excel sheet, contact me if you want it. 

Domain area: Supply Chain Management. you can use it and revise it based on any domain. 
Technology used: Asp.net, C#, SQL, VBA

Note: 
The project contains of two pages:
index and contact_pages 
1- index: 
Its the main page and works fine, however , I erase the database info , you should use your own database. So the form will be open if you run it, but 
it will not work if you try to write or read from the database. 

2- contact_pages:
Its not a contact page actually , it just addtional page, for testing codes. You can ignore it. 

3- I have excel sheet programed to have the ability to acces the database and retrive the suplier information from it. I didnt uplud it. 
Contact me if you need it. alzaidt@gmail.com
